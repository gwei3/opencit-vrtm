-The nontpmkss makefiles are for Non-TPM version of keyNegoServer
-The nontpmrpcs makefiles are for Non-TPM version of tcService/rpcoreservice
-The differences are minimal so can be optimized later by creating a common lib for TPM and NON-TPM versions.[Not an issue as m/c are fast but can be done later]
