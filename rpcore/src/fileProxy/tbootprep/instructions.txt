Loading TPM support

Ubuntu Linux w/ gcc
    sudo apt-get install trousers (http://sourceforge.net/projects/trousers/files/)
    sudo apt-get install tpm-tools
    sudo apt-get install libtspi-dev
    sudo apt-get install gcc

    Turn on the TPM
        Go to BIOS and make sure the TPM is on
            (if it is and you donâ€™t know owner auth, you may want to clear it and start over).
        Start up tcsd (sudo tcsd start)
        Make sure you can run the TPM tools (use tpm_getpubek)
        Take ownership using tpm_takeownership â€“z
            (The â€“z sets the SRK password to all zeros, the default âwell known secret)
            Use 123 for the owner_auth for this class

        Note: If your machine doesnâ€™t have the TPM listed in its ACPI table,
        you can still get the device driver to use it
            In that case you must use:
                sudo modprobe tpm_tis force=1 interrupts=0
                sudo tcsd start
