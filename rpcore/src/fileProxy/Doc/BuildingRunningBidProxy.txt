BidProxy

To build, in ROOT (jlmcrypt),
    mkdir bidServerobjects
    mkdir bidClientobjects
    mkdir sellerClientobjects
    mkdir bidNegoobjects
    mkdir bidClient
    mkdir sellerClient
    mkdir sellerClient/bids
    mkdir bidServer
    mkdir bidServer/bids
    mkdir bidNegoServer

In Code/bidProxy
    make -f bidClient.mak
    make -f bidServer.mak
    make -f sellerClient.mak
In Code bidNegoServer
    make -f bidNegoServer.mak

Make up an activity policy key pair and embed the public key certificate in bidClient, sellerClient
and bidServer as with fileClient and fileServer.

Two scripts facilitate the execution of XML tests as for fileProxy. These two
scripts can be found at CODE/scripts/provisionAuction.sh and
CODE/scripts/runAuction.sh. The latter test assumes that there is a single XML
test directory under bidClient/tests, and it clears out all bids from
sellerClient/bids and bidServer/bids before running the test and checking the
results. It also assumes that the auction id is 1.

Run CODE/scripts/provisionAuction.sh to set up sellerClient and bidServer for a
set of auctions. Run CODE/scripts/runAuction.sh to run a single auction
directory in bidClient/tests/. The python script
CODE/scripts/createSimpleBidTest.py can be used to create a set of
bidProxy tests with a given number of principals.
