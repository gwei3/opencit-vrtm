wrt fileClient and fileServer not being able to reach keyNegoServer, my only suspicion 
is that something else is still holding the port (like a zombie keyNegoServer or 
perhaps an X program, since the default ports in FileProxy are normally used for X 
programs; see http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/ip/ports06000.htm . You can 
see port usage with "sudo netstat -tulnp".  And I would strongly recommend for your tests 
that you remove all the keys in fileSever/, fileClient/, and TrustedOS/, and all the 
*.exe's in ROOT and reboot and try from scratch like that if you haven't already.

In the meantime, here's a recipe to either reproduce the same results as me (or not).  
Either way, it will be interesting.

I believe you've already run my createSimpleTest.py script in ROOT to get the test 
directory basicTest.  You can use the file CODE/SupportFiles/tests/transferTiming/tests.xml 
to get longer tests that should work with the earlier checkin and fail with the merge 
checkin.  Here's how, starting in ROOT and assuming basicTest is in ROOT/fileClient/tests

cp -r $ROOT/fileClient/tests/basicTest $ROOT/fileClient/tests/transferTiming
cp $CODE/SupportFiles/tests/transferTiming/tests.xml $ROOT/fileClient/tests/transferTiming/
cd $CODE
git checkout a91d25b8e36
make clean && make

.... copy the files to ROOT as usual for the test and run the test ... this should work

Then you can try the merged version

cd $CODE
git checkout 3ab9cc10a018a09
make clean && make 

-- copy the files to ROOT as usual for a clean test and run the test .... 
this should fail at file size 2048. 


You can get back to the current HEAD of master with 

git checkout master

And note that your working directory has to be clean for the git checkout commands to work (no uncommitted files)

I'd rather not try to debug things at the HEAD of master until we can get the code working at 
this merge point.  Then we can roll forward to figure out what's changed.
