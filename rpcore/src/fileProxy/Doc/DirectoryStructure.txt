Directory structure for building and running FileProxy
======================================================


Development Computer

ROOT 
    This directory contains the executables and it is the top level 
    directory for all program development output files as well as 
    operational files.  We refer to this directory as ROOT and you
    must edit the makefiles to reflect the location on your machines.
    As distributed, the ROOT directory is ~/jlmcrypt in the makefiles.

    Log files containing debugging output during execution also land
    in ROOT.

    Example files include:
        ROOT/fileClient.exe        # FileClient executable for debugging
                                   # Production executable is in intiramfs
        ROOT/fileServer.exe        # FileServer executable for debugging
                                   # Production executable is in intiramfs
        ROOT/keyNegoServer.exe     # keyNegoServer executable
        ROOT/keyNegoServer.log     # keyNegoServer log output
        ROOT/policy/privatePolicyKey.xml  # private policy key (used to sign Certs)
        ROOT/tcioDD.ko             # Loadable tcioDD device driver
        ROOT/tcService.exe         # tcService executable for debugging
                                   # Production executable is in intiramfs
        ROOT/tcService.log         # tcService debugging output
        ROOT/vTCIDirect.exe        # TPM initialization executable
        ROOT/cryptUtility.exe      # cryptUtility executable
