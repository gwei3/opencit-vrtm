Using the Git Repository
========================


The repository access paths are:
    https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/git/users/manfer/fileProxyPapers.git
    https://repo.eecs.berkeley.edu/git/users/manfer/fileProxy.git

git push -u origin master


Getting the certificates

Linux:

The repository server (like many other departmental servers) uses an InCommon 
derived certificate and some machines do not include the InCommon root certificate 
in the default ca-certificates file. You may be able to add the missing certificate 
to your ca-certificates file, as follows:
 wget http://cert.incommon.org/InCommonServerCA.crt
 openssl x509 -inform DER -in InCommonServerCA.crt -out InCommonServerCA.pem
 cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt InCommonServerCA.pem > ca-certs2.crt
 sudo cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.bak
 sudo cp ca-certs2.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

If the above does not work for you, then try these steps below:
1. Go to https://iris.eecs.berkeley.edu/news/6499-new-ssl-certificate-for-wireless 
and download the Root and Intermediate certificates
https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=downloads&_a=viewdownload&downloaditemid=9
https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=downloads&_a=viewdownload&downloaditemid=101
2. Create a director and copy the two certificate files into it
  sudo mkdir â€“p /usr/share/ca-certificates/repo
  sudo cp <location_of_downloaded_certs>/*.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates/repo/
3. Edit /etc/ca-certificates.conf as root (or sudo), at the end, add
  repo/AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt
  repo/COMODOHigh-AssuranceSecureServerCA.crt
  repo/InCommonServerCA.pem
4. Run
  sudo update-ca-certificates


However, this means that you need to enter your username and password
each time you want to do a remote operation, so I prefer the SSH
version, since I can use ssh-agent to keep track of my key.
