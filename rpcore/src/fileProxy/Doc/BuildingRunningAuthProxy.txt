AuthProxy

To build, in ROOT (jlmcrypt),
    mkdir authServerobjects
    mkdir authClientobjects
    mkdir authNegoobjects
    mkdir authClient
    mkdir authServer
    mkdir authNegoServer

In Code/authProxy
    make -f authClient.mak
    make -f authServer.mak
In Code authNegoServer
    make -f authNegoServer.mak


Two scripts facilitate the execution of tests in authClient.exe; these two tests
can be found in CODE/scripts/provisionAuthTests.sh and
CODE/scripts/runAuthTests.sh. These two scripts can be executed from ROOT to set
up an authServer (provisionAuthTests.sh) with a new signing key and run a set of
tests as specified in authClient.exe.
