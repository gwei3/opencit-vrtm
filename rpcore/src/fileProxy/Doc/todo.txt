Todo
====

1. Measure hashes and add to KeyNegoServer db

2. 2048 bit keys, CBC encrypt and mac (rather than mac then encrypt),
   Fix timing attack.  More optimization? SHA-3, ECC.

3. Individual file keys to avoid escalation of privilige 
   based on file names.

4. PCR18 (19 too if lcp is set)

5. Check for leaks buffer overflows

------------------------------------------------------   

6. Hypervisor
    Management partition
        schedule, start vm's, montoring, update
    VM update and keys

7. keyNegoServer: emergency key recovery program, revocation
            file key escrow and update


8. Fix vTCI to handle TPM owner password

9. Check on filelock in tcService (How long does it last?)
   Not necessary now.  executables should be in initramfs and write protected.
   Need to revist for Hv.
