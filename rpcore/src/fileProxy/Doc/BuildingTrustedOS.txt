Instructions for building and booting the Trusted OS
====================================================


Create the directory that the TrustedOS will find its
keys, certificates and where it stores its files.  By
default, this is ROOT/TrustedOS.

Before building tcioDD, open the Makefile and edit
KDIR to point to the module build directory for the 
kernel the tcioDD will be loaded into. The current
version is for the stock 3.7.5 kernel, which installs
the build directory into /lib/modules/3.7.5/build.

Build the tcioDD device driver.
    cd Devices
    make
