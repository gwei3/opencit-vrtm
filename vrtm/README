bin/
	Exceutables of RPCore.
	TODO: RPProxy, RPListener binaries should be included here as well -- Makefile to update.
bin-03-20-14/
	exact copy of bin as of 03-20-2014. -- Ideally we don't need to keep track of binaries, 
	they shall be compiled at each local machine once src code checked out. But somehow 
	RPCore seems compiles and runs on some machine, but not on some other machines; reason 
	to be figured out. So we include RPCore binaries in git repository. 
	bin/* might changed due to development and recompilation. 
	bin-mm-dd-yy/ snapshot of binaries that we know work across machines.
src/
	All source code.
rptmp/
	Configuration files for RPCore. This directory needs to be copied to /tmp/, and for each
	machine, it needs to be reconfigured. See RPCore installation and configuration doc.
