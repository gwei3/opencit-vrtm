In the mysterhill/docs/setup/compute_node_installation directory you will find documents
describing how to set up a KVM node and a XEN/Nova Compute node using the new
scripts and tar files created on a build machine using the build scripts.

Also in the ClientTool directory you will find Client_build_instructions.txt, a document describing how to use the Client_build.sh script on
a machine that has access to the git repository at 192.55.66.14.  This will build
the java code, Manifest Tool that runs in a GUI.  It is also known as the Client Tool. 

Again in the ClientTool directory you will find Client_tool_instructions.txt which
describes the procedure for getting the certificates set up so that the Client Tool
can communicate with the Mt Wilson server.

Finally in the ClientTool directory there is a document, Client_Tool_Usage.docx,
which shows how to navigate through the graphical interface of the Client Tool.
