Client_build.sh and the Client Tool should be run on a machine running Ubuntu
12.04 or greater and also running some version of X windows.

Add the ssh public key from the new Client Tool machine to ~repo/.ssh/authorized_keys
and ~a/.ssh/authorized_keys on the machine at 192.55.66.14 FIRST.

Then:
./Client_build.sh --help
to show the usage.

In a root shell in the directory to clone mysteryhill repository to or where it exists:
./Client_build.sh

You will be prompted for the username enabled for ssh to Avalonia - 192.55.66.14
This is the username that works for running this command:
ssh repo@192.55.66.14

If Version 1.7 of the java jdk is not installed, it will be installed by the script.

You will also be prompted to:
	"Enter the Glance IP address"
This could be the same machine you are running the script on or a different machine that is running glance that the Virtual Machine images and manifests will be uploaded to.
	"Enter the KMS Server IP address"
This could also be the same machine you are running the script on, but it is the machine that the KMS Server is running on.

After the script finishes,
cd /opt/RP_$Current_Date/ManifestTool
Then check and verify all the values in resources/config.properties

See Client_tool_instructions.txt for instructions on running Client Tool (Manifest Tool).
