Steps for client tool integration with KMS (for registering the decryption key)

1. Copy the MH server TLS certificate (ssl.crt) and key management certificate (<id>.crt) to the client
	1.1 get-tls-certificate 
	# cd ManifestTool
	# java -jar resources/client-0.1-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar get-tls-certificate --format=DER https://10.35.34.201:8443 > ssl.crt
	This gets the ssl.crt from the mhserver (kms).

	1.2 Import tls certificate
	# java -jar resources/client-0.1-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar import-tls-certificate --format=DER ssl.crt
	Provide the same password which is provided on the MH server side while creating the tls certificate 
	This creates tls-truststore.jks in /root/.mystery-hill/client

	1.3 Copy the <id>.crt certificate (Key management certificate) from server side to client
	scp /root/mhserver/.mhserver/private/0654c7fb9573c6fe023ddd2465171b1b.crt root@mh-client:/opt/RP/ManifestTool/

	1.4 Import data encryption key recipient on client
	# java -jar resources/client-0.1-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar import-data-encryption-key-recipient --format=DER 0654c7fb9573c6fe023ddd2465171b1b.crt
	This will create a keystore file 'dek-recipients.jks' either in the current directory or under ~/.mystery-hill/client/

2. Find the keyword "Uncomment the following" in the following files and follow the comments
	src/manifesttool/ui/UserConfirmation.java
	src/manifesttool/utils/MHUtilityOperation.java
	Here need to uncomment few lines with commenting some other lines

3. Add the following properties in "resources/config.properties" (along with other properties)
	KMS_Server_IP=10.35.34.46
	MH_Key_Name=demokey
	MH_Keystore_Location=/root/.mystery-hill/client/dek-recipients.jks
	MH_Keystore_Password=password     -- (Same password that is provided on the MH server side while creating tls certificate)
	MH_TLS_SSL_Passwd=password        -- (Same password that is provided on MH server side while creating management certificate)
