Copy XEN_install.sh and XEN_install_$date.tar.gz into the home directory on a machine with Ubuntu 13.04 server installed.

Run ./XEN_install.sh --help to get a usage statement.

Run:
sudo bash
or:
sudo su

then:
./XEN_install.sh

The script will prompt for these inputs:
Openstack XEN Dom0 Compute IP
Gateway IP for Openstack XEN Dom0 Compute node
DNS nameserver IP for Openstack KVM Compute node

When the script completes, reboot.  Then:
Copy XEN_install_after_reboot.sh into the same directory as XEN_install_$date.tar.gz.

Run:
sudo bash
or:
sudo su

then:
./XEN_install_after_reboot.sh

Respond with upper case "YES" when prompted about whether you want to create SR storage.

Enter the device that will contain the SR storage i.e. /dev/sda4

Enter the Size in GB requested for the LVM (logical volume) of the SR. You will be shown how much is available on the selected device.

When the script completes, reboot.  Then:
Copy NOVA_compute_install.sh into the home directory.
Add the ssh public key from the new XEN machine to ~repo/.ssh/authorized_keys
and ~a/.ssh/authorized_keys on the machine at 192.55.66.14 FIRST.
OR, download base_image_compute_new to the directory NOVA_compute_install.sh will be run from.
Then in a root shell:
./NOVA_compute_install.sh
You will be prompted for the username enabled for ssh to Avalonia - 192.55.66.14 if base_image_compute_new is not already downloaded to this machine.

This will set up and start the NOVA compute node.
xe console uuid=$Base_UUID
(Base_UUID will come on the screen at the end of the script)


Then log into it as root with the usual password:
Then set the ip address: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.xx to be able to download the following script:

After downloading, run:
./NOVA_compute_config.sh
while logged into the NOVA compute node.

The script will prompt for these inputs:
Openstack Controller IP
Openstack Nova Compute IP
Dom0 IP
Gateway IP for Openstack XEN Dom0 Compute node
DNS nameserver IP for Openstack KVM Compute node
Flat interface (default is eth0)
Public interface (default is eth0)
