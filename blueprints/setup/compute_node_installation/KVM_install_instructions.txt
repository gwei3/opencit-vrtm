Copy KVM_install.sh and KVM_install_$date.tar.gz into the home directory on a machine with Ubuntu 12.04 server installed.

Run ./KVM_install.sh --help to get a usage statement.

Run:
sudo bash
or:
sudo su

then:
./KVM_install.sh

The script will prompt for these inputs:
Openstack Controller IP
Openstack KVM Compute IP
Gateway IP for Openstack KVM Compute node
DNS nameserver IP for Openstack KVM Compute node
Flat interface (default is eth0)
Public interface (default is eth0)

On the MtWilson server:
cd /etc/intel/cloudsecurity
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in saml.crt.pem  > pubkey.pem

Copy pubkey.pem from the MtWilson server into the directory that contains verifier: /opt/RP*/rpcore/bin/debug on the KVM node.
verifier looks for pubkey.pem in its own directory.
