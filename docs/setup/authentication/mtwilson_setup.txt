		      Mt Wilson Installation

To install the new version of Trust Agent, you must first install the new 2.0.0 version of MtWilson.  This is the sequence:

copy mtwilson-server-2.0.0-jdk_glassfish_monit.bin from avalonia in ~repo/mtw
Uninstall mtw:
1.       mtwilson erase-users --all
2.       mtwilson erase-data
3.       mtwilson uninstall

The most important file to have in the same directory and in /root
for Mt Wilson install is mtwilson.env. Update it with the correct IP
address before using.

There is a sample of mtwilson.env here on Avalonia: /home/a/mtwilson.env

Run MTW installer:
4.       ./mtwilson-server-2.0.0-jdk_glassfish_monit.bin

If you get an HTTP error in the Client tool log when it tries to access Mt Wilson.
Download this file from Avalonia:
~repo/mtw/mtwilson-vm-attestation-ws-v2-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Replace this file: /usr/share/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/applications/mtwilson/WEB-INF/lib/mtwilson-vm-attestation-ws-v2-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
with the one just downloaded.
Then run this command:
/usr/share/glassfish4/glassfish/bin/asadmin restart-domain domain1
