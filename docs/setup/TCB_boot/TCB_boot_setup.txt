		TCB Boot Setup Instructions

1. Get a copy of the scripts by cloning a copy of mysteryhill-tcb-protection:
git clone repo@192.55.66.14:~/dev/mysteryhill-tcb-protection
or
Request a tar file of the TCB-Protection file structure.

2. You will need a cleared partition on the hard disk i.e. /dev/sda2
cd TCB-Protection
./setup_encrypted_lvm.sh
Enter the device path after the prompt for it: /dev/sda2
I suggest at least 10G for the host volume, at least 1G for the storage,
and make the swap size about the same as the RAM size.

If you have previously run setup_encrypted_lvm.sh and need to delete
the old encrypted volumes, take a look at XEN_install_after_reboot.sh.
It has code for deleting previously created volumes in case it was run before.

To use the brute force method to get rid of previous encrypted LocalStorage:
ll /dev/mapper
cat /proc/partitions
fdisk /dev/dm-7	# Rewrite the partition table for the parent partition
		# Enter w as a command to write the partition
partprobe	# Have the OS read the new partition


3. There is a script, configure_trusted_host.sh, that I recommend
running to set up an entry in /boot/grub/grub.cfg for the TCB boot.
It will also install a default version of rootfs.tar.gz.  After
running it, you should be able to do a TCB boot of the default
system.

4. Then you will want to create a rootfs.tar.gz file the is an image
of the system configured as you want it with tboot and KVM or XEN
installed.

The files in the directory that you run create_rootfs_tarball.sh
from will not be included in the rootfs.tar.gz file.  I did
something like this:
mkdir /create
mkdir ~/TCB-Protection
cp -a mysteryhill-tcb-protection/TCB-Protection/* ~/TCB-Protection
(This does not copy the .git directory)
(Also all the non-.git files in the directory need to be copied
because there is a file in the script directory that must be there.)
mv mysteryhill-tcb-protection/TCB-Protection /create
(Prevent including the git repository in rootfs.tar.gz)
cd /create
~/TCB-Protection/create_rootfs_tarball.sh

The output file is /rootfs.tar.gz
mv /rootfs.tar.gz /boot

mv /create/TCB-Protection mysteryhill-tcb-protection

5. Then copy /boot/rootfs.tar.gz to the Client tool machine and
run the client tool after putting:
Host_Manifest=true
in resources/config.properties

When browsing the directories, click on Add Directory and
add /opt/RP_$date/rpcore

When finished creating the manifest file, copy it to the
TCB boot machine into the /boot directory and rename it:
tcb-manifest.xml

6. Next run the script:
./generate_initrd.sh
cp -p initrd_output/initrd.img* /boot

If you want the machine to automatically boot in TCB,
in /boot/grub/grub.cfg you can change the default line to:
set default="TCB-protection"

7. You should now be able to boot into the clone of the
system now running, but in TCB mode.
